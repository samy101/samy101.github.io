I am an Assistant Professor at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems (RBCCPS)](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral scholar at the Berkeley Education Alliance for Research in Singapore([BEARS](http://bears.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) Limited, a research center of the University of California, Berkeley, located in Singapore. I worked for the [SinBerBEST 2](http://sinberbest.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} program (Theme D: Data Analytics for the Built Environment) under [Prof. Kameshwar Poolla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kameshwar_Poolla){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi [(IIIT-Delhi)](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, India, under the guidance of [Dr. Amarjeet Singh](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~amarjeet/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Prof. Pushpendra Singh](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~pushpendra/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Before that, I received my Master's degree in computer applications from [Madurai Kamaraj University](https://mkuniversity.ac.in/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Tamilnadu, India.

My current research interests lie in the intersection of Cyber-Physical Systems and Data Science and their applications pertaining to smart built environments and energy sustainability. Specifically, I focus on developing systems and techniques for energy monitoring, benchmarking, prediction, anomaly detection, and fault detection and diagnosis by leveraging smart meter time series and other opportunistic data sources. I have recently started investigating how to leverage Infrared Thermography (IRT) for city-scale building diagnostics and energy auditing.

**Hiring Alert**: I am actively looking for highly motivated candidates for various positions, including Project Assistant, M.Tech/PhD Research, and Postdoc. If you are interested, please get in touch with me through email.
