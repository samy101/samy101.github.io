I am a postdoctoral scholar at Berkeley Education Alliance for Research in Singapore ([BEARS](http://bears.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) Limited, a University of California, Berkeley's research centre, in Singapore. I work for the [SinBerBEST 2](http://sinberbest.berkeley.edu/) program (Theme D: Data Analytics for the Built Environment) under [Prof. Kameshwar Poolla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kameshwar_Poolla). I did my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi
[(IIIT-Delhi)](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/), India under the guidance of [Dr. Amarjeet Singh](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~amarjeet/) and [Prof. Pushpendra Singh](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~pushpendra/). Before that, I have received my Master degree in computer applications from [Madurai Kamaraj University](https://mkuniversity.ac.in/new/), Tamilnadu, India.

My current research interests lie in the intersection of Data Science and Cyber-Physical Systems, and their applications pertaining to smart environments and energy sustainability. Specifically, I focus on developing systems and techniques for energy monitoring, benchmarking, prediction, and anomaly detection by leveraging smart meter and other opportunistic data sources. More recently, I have started investigating how we can leverage Infrared Thermography (IRT) for city-scale building diagnostics and energy auditing.
