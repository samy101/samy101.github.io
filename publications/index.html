      <p>Building energy use benchmarking is the process of measuring the energy performance of buildings relative to their peer group for creating awareness and identifying energy-saving opportunities. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of BEEM, a data-driven energy use benchmarking system for buildings in Singapore. The peer groups for comparison are established using a public energy disclosure data set. We use an ensemble tree algorithm for accurately modeling building energy use and for identifying the most influential factors. Our models reduce the prediction error from 24.39% to 6.04%, on average, when compared to the baseline linear regression models, which were used in the previous energy efficiency labeling program in Singapore, and outperforms ten other recent models. Using the prototype implementation of BEEM, we benchmarked three building types, office (290), hotel (203), and retail (125), and compared their rating. The code repository and the accompanying data set are released as an open-source project for community use.</p>

      <p>Collecting accurate information about the operational characteristics of buildings is essential for many performance analyses including energy auditing and benchmarking. While most of the existing solutions involve manual inspection of building premises, surveys, or in-situ sensor deployment, these techniques are intrusive and/or time-intensive, limiting their applicability at larger, city-level spatial scales. Complementing these solutions, we present a wide-area infrared thermography (IRT) based system for measuring a building’s operational characteristics remotely in a non-intrusive and scalable way, and we describe the image capture, processing pipeline, and preliminary results from an initial deployment of this system focusing on the operational characteristics of air-conditioning units. The data collection consisted of infrared imaging of a residential building for 50 days at continuous 10-second intervals. The infrared brightness variations of exterior split air-conditioners fixtures were extracted for each image, and operational attributes were then extracted from the resultant time series. Using state-based change point detection methods to determine times at which air-conditioners are operational, our preliminary analysis focuses on phenomenological patterns of activity with two main findings. First, we demonstrate our ability to determine the operational characteristics of air-conditioners and in particular the fact that they exhibit two distinct modes: continuous operation and cycling behavior. Second, we find that the fraction of "on" time spent in the cycling mode is characteristically longer for lower external temperatures, consistent with the hypothesis that the cycling mode represents a reaching of set temperature. Finally, we outline future research directions and challenges in leveraging IRT for behavioral studies of cooling system use and proactive assessment of air-conditioners towards the development of scalable virtual energy auditing.</p>

      <p>This paper describes an open data set of 3,053 energy meters from 1,636 non-residential buildings with a range of two full years (2016 and 2017) at an hourly frequency (17,544 measurements per meter resulting in approximately 53.6 million measurements). These meters were collected from 19 sites across North America and Europe, with one or more meters per building measuring whole building electrical, heating and cooling water, steam, and solar energy as well as water and irrigation meters. Part of these data were used in the Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) competition hosted by the ASHRAE organization in October-December 2019. GEPIII was a machine learning competition for long-term prediction with an application to measurement and verification. This paper describes the process of data collection, cleaning, and convergence of time-series meter data, the meta-data about the buildings, and complementary weather data. This data set can be used for further prediction benchmarking and prototyping as well as anomaly detection, energy analysis, and building type classification.</p>

      <p>In late 2019, ASHRAE hosted the Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) machine learning competition on the Kaggle platform. This launch marked the third energy prediction competition from ASHRAE and the first since the mid-1990s. In this updated version, the competitors were provided with over 20 million points of training data from 2,380 energy meters collected for 1,448 buildings from 16 sources. This competition’s overall objective was to find the most accurate modeling solutions for the prediction of over 41 million private and public test data points. The competition had 4,370 participants, split across 3,614 teams from 94 countries who submitted 39,403 predictions. In addition to the top five winning workflows, the competitors publicly shared 415 reproducible online machine learning workflow examples (notebooks), including over 40 additional, full solutions. This paper gives a high-level overview of the competition preparation and dataset, competitors and their discussions, machine learning workflows and models generated, winners and their submissions, discussion of lessons learned, and competition outputs and next steps. The most popular and accurate machine learning workflows used large ensembles of mostly gradient boosting tree models, such as LightGBM. Similar to the first predictor competition, preprocessing of the data sets emerged as a key differentiator.</p>

      <p>Building energy performance benchmarking has been adopted widely in the USA and Canada through the Energy Star Portfolio Manager platform. Building operations and energy management professionals have long used this simple 1–100 score to understand how their building compares to its peers. This single number is easy to use but is created by potentially inaccurate multiple linear regression (MLR) models and lacks much further information about why a building achieves that score. This paper proposes a methodology that enhances the existing Energy Star calculation method by increasing accuracy and providing additional model output processing to help explain why a building is achieving a particular score. Two new prediction models were proposed and tested: multiple linear regression with feature interactions (MLRi) and gradient boosted trees (GBT). Both models performed better than a baseline Energy Star MLR model as well as four baseline models from previous benchmarking studies. This paper shows that for six building types, on average, the third-order MLRi models achieved a 4.9% increase in adjusted R-squared and a 7.0% decrease in normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) over the baseline MLR model. More substantially, the most accurate GBT models, on average, achieved a 24.9% increase in adjusted R-squared and a 13.7% decrease in NMRSE against the baseline MLR model. In addition, a set of techniques was developed to help determine which factors most influence a building’s energy use versus its peers using SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values. The SHAP force visualization, in particular, offered an accessible overview of the aspects of the building that influenced the score that even non-technical users can interpret. This methodology was tested on the 2012 Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)(1,812 buildings) and public data sets from the energy disclosure programs of New York City (11,131 buildings) and Seattle (2,073 buildings).</p>

      <p>Many energy performance analysis methodologies assign buildings a descriptive label that represents their main activity, often known as the primary space usage (PSU). This attribute comes from the intent of the design team based on assumptions of how the majority of the spaces in the building will be used. In reality, the way a building’s occupants use the spaces can be different than what was intended. With the recent growth of hourly electricity meter data from the built environment, there is the opportunity to create unsupervised methods to analyze electricity consumption behavior to understand whether the PSU assigned is accurate. Misclassification or oversimplification of the use of the building is possible using these labels when applied to simulation inputs or benchmarking processes. To work towards accurate characterization of a building’s utilization, we propose a modular methodology for identifying potentially mislabeled buildings using distance-based clustering analysis based on hourly electricity consumption data. This method seeks to segment buildings according to their daily behavior and predict which ones are misfits according to their assigned PSU label. This process finds potentially uncharacteristic behavior that could be an indication of mixed-use or a misclassified PSU. Our results on two public data sets, from the Building Data Genome (BDG) Project and Washington DC (DGS), with 507 and 322 buildings respectively, show that 26% and 33% of these buildings are potentially mislabelled based on their load shape behavior. Such information provides a more realistic insight into their true consumption characteristics, enabling more accurate simulation scenarios. Applications of this process and a discussion of limitations and reproducibility are included.</p>

      <p>Maintaining both indoor air quality (IAQ) and thermal comfort in buildings along with optimized energy consumption is a challenging problem. This investigation presents a novel design for hybrid ventilation system enabled by predictive control and soft-sensors to achieve both IAQ and thermal comfort by combining predictive control with demand controlled ventilation (DCV). First, we show that the problem of maintaining IAQ, thermal comfort and optimal energy is a multi-objective optimization problem with competing objectives, and a predictive control approach is required to smartly control the system. This leads to many implementation challenges which are addressed by designing a hybrid ventilation scheme supported by predictive control and soft-sensors. The main idea of the hybrid ventilation system is to achieve thermal comfort by varying the ON/OFF times of the air conditioners to maintain the temperature within user-defined bands using a predictive control and IAQ is maintained using Healthbox 3.0, a DCV device. Furthermore, this study also designs soft-sensors by combining the Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors with deep-learning tools. The hardware realization of the control and IoT prototype is also discussed. The proposed novel hybrid ventilation system and the soft-sensors are demonstrated in a real research laboratory, i.e., Center for Research in Automatic Control Engineering (C-RACE) located at Kalasalingam University, India. Our results show the perceived benefits of hybrid ventilation, predictive control, and soft-sensors.</p>

      <p>Buildings are responsible for 30–40% of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption worldwide. Thus, reducing the overall energy use and associated emissions in buildings is crucial for meeting sustainability goals for the future. In recent years, smart energy meters have been deployed to enable monitoring of energy use data with hourly or sub-hourly temporal resolution. The concurrent rise of information technologies and data analytics enabled the development of novel applications such as customer segmentation, load profiling, demand response, energy forecasting and anomaly detection. In this paper, we address load profiling and benchmarking, i.e., determining peer groups for buildings. Traditionally, static characteristics, e.g., primary space use (PSU) together with the annual energy-use-intensity (EUI) have been used to compare the performance of buildings. Data-driven benchmarking approaches have begun to also consider the shape of the load profiles as a means for comparison. In this work, we identify three fundamental load shape profiles that characterize the temporal energy use in any building. We obtain this result by collecting a dataset of unprecedented variety in size (3829 buildings) and primary use (75 programs), and applying a rigorous clustering analysis followed by entropy calculation for each building. The existence of fundamental load shape profiles challenges the man-made, artificial classification of buildings. We demonstrate in a benchmarking application that the resulting data-driven groups are more homogeneous, and therefore more suitable for comparisons between buildings. Our findings have potential implications for portfolio management, building and urban energy simulations, demand response and renewable energy integration in buildings.</p>

      <p>As one of the largest consumers of overall energy, buildings have emerged as attractive targets for using information and communications technologies to advance large-scale sustainability goals. With increasing availability and affordability of sophisticated sensing, control and computational methods, a variety of novel applications have been envisioned in the recent past aiming towards energy savings. However, the centralized building management system with its inflexible and isolated subsystems, currently used to manage the building operations, restrict the widespread development and deployment of novel energy management applications. In this thesis, we hypothesize that decentralized, flexible, and extensible software systems, together with novel applications and analytical techniques, would improve the energy efficiency in buildings. To support our hypothesis, we present the architecture, design, development, and experimental validation of middleware systems for building energy management, which enable 1) decentralized management of building resources involving different stakeholders, including occupants, to make control-over decisions and energy management policies, by providing appropriate finegrained access-control mechanisms, 2) flexible interfaces for integrating existing and retrofitted sensing and control systems, and suitable software representations for accessing and managing their operations, e.g. spatio-hierarchical relationship, which are specific to buildings, and 3) an extensible automation framework for developing and deploying energy management applications involving simple and advanced sensor data processing methods for identifying detailed insights about the operational context of the building, and suitable programming abstractions for developers. We evaluate these systems through multiple real-world deployments in our test-bed buildings consisting of varied categories of functionalities, operations, users, and hundreds of heterogeneous sensor data streams, across the world. On top of this, we also implemented several practical applications ranging from detecting the deviation in the energy usage of building subvi systems to inferring fine-grained building context using proxy sources. The practical usability of the system was also evaluated through a user study. In summary, this thesis attempts to present a holistic software ecosystem and novel applications by bringing the three major entities – devices, computational methods, and humans, in buildings closer towards optimal energy management.</p>

      <p>Buildings are one of the largest energy consumers around the world. Several studies show that degraded and misconfigured devices waste upto 30% of energy in commercial buildings. In this paper, we propose Collect, Compare, and Score (CCS), a generic anomaly detection method that can be used across buildings following different energy usage patterns. CCS is a density based approach. We evaluate CCS using a real-world dataset, consisting of 16 weeks of data from commercial and residential buildings. We find average Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.92 for CSS and 0.78 for baseline method.</p>

      <p>Anomaly detection is an important problem in building energy management in order to identify energy theft and inefficiencies. However, it is hard to differentiate actual anomalies from the genuine changes in energy consumption due to seasonal variations and changes in personal settings such as holidays. One of the important drawbacks of existing anomaly detection algorithms is that various unknown context variables, such as seasonal variations, can affect the energy consumption of users in ways that appear anomalous to existing time series based anomaly detection algorithms.In this paper, we present a system for monitoring the energy consumption of multiple users within a neighborhood and a novel algorithm for detecting anomalies by combining data from multiple users. For each user, the neighborhood is defined as the set of all other users that have similar characteristics (function, location or demography), and are therefore likely to react and consume energy in the similar way in response to the external conditions. The neighborhood can be predefined based on prior customer information, or can be identified through an analysis of historical energy consumption. The proposed algorithm works as a two-step process. In the first step, the algorithm periodically computes an anomaly score for each user by just considering their own energy consumption and variations in the consumption of the past. In the second step, the anomaly score for a user is adjusted by analyzing the energy consumption data in the neighborhood. The collation of data within the neighborhood allows the proposed algorithm to differentiate between these genuine effects and real anomalous behavior of users. Unlike multivariate time series anomaly detection algorithms, the proposed algorithm can identify specific users that are exhibiting anomalous behavior. The capabilities of the algorithm are demonstrated using several year-long real-world data sets, for commercial as well as residential consumers.</p>

      <p>Towards the realization of smart building applications, buildings are increasingly instrumented with diverse sensors and actuators. These sensors generate large volumes of data which can be analyzed for optimizing building operations. Many building energy management tasks such as energy forecasting, disaggregation, among others require complex analytics leveraging collected sensor data. While several standalone and cloud-based systems for archiving, sharing and visualizing sensor data have emerged, their support for analyzing sensor data streams is primitive and limited to rule-based actions based on thresholds and simple aggregation functions. We develop OpenBAN, an open source sensor data analytics middleware for buildings, to make analytics an integral component of modern smart building applications. OpenBAN provides a framework of extensible sensor data processing elements for identifying various building context, which different applications can leverage. We validate the capabilities of OpenBAN by developing three representative real-world applications which are deployed in our test-bed buildings: (i) household energy disaggregation, (ii) detection of sprinkler usage from water meter data, and (iii) electricity demand forecasting. We also provide a preliminary system performance of OpenBAN when deployed in the cloud and locally.</p>

      <p>Buildings, with their different subsystems interacting with diverse occupants, constitute a complex Cyber-Physical-Human infrastructure. Monitoring and controlling this complex ecosystem is essential both for efficient and optimized operations of building subsystems and for influencing the occupant behavior. A critical enabling technology in this case is a middleware system for buildings that can provide support for deriving rich inferences by fusing and analyzing intentionally acquired or opportunistically available data from diverse embedded sensors, human feedback, and existing building subsystems. This paper presents Sensor Act, a Scriptable middleware system architecture for energy management applications in buildings. In addition to providing support for managing and integrating heterogeneous sensing and actuation systems in buildings, Sensor Act provides two emerging features: (1) a scripting framework for application developers to extend and automate the various energy management functions of the buildings, and (2) a rule-based sensor data and control sharing mechanism for fine-grained sharing for building owners. We describe the detailed system architecture and design, and provide proof of concept through multiple third party applications built using Sensor Act APIs and deployment in diverse settings across India and United States. Sensor Act is released in open source for community use.</p>

      <p>Electricity demand prediction is important for several real world applications such as Demand Response (DR) program for peak demand management. For utilities with many customers, learning a best fit baseline for every consumer may be time consuming. We propose E-Adivino: an electricity forecasting framework that first clusters customers based on their consumption pattern followed by forecasting for each cluster using a generalized baseline projection approach. E-Adivino allows for selection of appropriate models for different consumers based on their demand patterns rather than using a uniform model for all the consumers, as is the practice today. E-Adivino is evaluated for its real world applicability using data from a university campus in India spanning over a year.</p>

      <p>Buildings are one of the largest consumers of electricity. Dominant electricity consumption within the buildings, contributed by plug loads, lighting and air conditioning, can be significantly improved using Occupancy-based Building Management Systems (Ob-BMS). In this paper, we address three critical aspects of Ob-BMS i.e. 1) Modular sensor node design to support diverse deployment scenarios; 2) Building architecture to support and scale fine resolution monitoring; and 3) Detailed analysis of the collected data for smarter actuation. We present key learning across these three aspects evolved over more than one year of design and deployment experiences. The sensor node design evolved over a period of time to address specific deployment requirements. With an opportunity at the host institute where two dorm buildings were getting constructed, we planned for the support infrastructure required for fine resolution monitoring embedded in the design phase and share our preliminary experiences and key learning thereof. Prototype deployment of the sensing system as per the planned support infrastructure was performed at two faculty offices with effective data collection worth 45 days. Collected data is analyzed accounting for efficient switching of appliances, in addition to energy conservation and user comfort as performed in the earlier occupancy based frameworks. Our analysis shows that occupancy prediction using simple heuristic based modeling can achieve similar performance as more complex Hidden Markov Models, thus simplifying the analytic framework.</p>

      <p>The archaic centralized software systems, currently used to manage buildings, make it hard to incorporate advances in sensing technology and user-level applications, and present hurdles for experimental validation of open research in building information technology. Motivated by this, we — a transnational collaboration of researchers engaged in development and deployment of technologies for sustainable buildings — have developed SensorAct, an open-source federated middleware incorporating features targeting three specific requirements: (i) Accommodating a richer ecosystem of sensors, actuators, and higher level third-party applications (ii) Participatory engagement of stakeholders other than the facilities department, such as occupants, in setting policies for management of sensor data and control of electrical systems, without compromising on the overall privacy and safety, and (iii) Flexible interfacing and information exchange with systems external to a building, such as communication networks, transportation system, electrical grid, and other buildings, for better management, by exploiting the teleconnections that exist across them. SensorAct is designed to scale from small homes to network of buildings, making it suitable not only for production use but to also seed a global-scale network of building testbeds with appropriately constrained and policed access. This paper describes SensorAct’s architecture, current implementation, and preliminary performance results.</p>

      <p>Ubiquitous availability of cellular network and cheap mobile phones have made them promising sensing platforms for various application domains including healthcare, environment, and astronomy among others. However, existing mobile phone platforms, including even smartphones, provide limited in-built sensing capabilities and lack standard interfaces to connect external sensors. In this paper, we propose MELOS (Mobile Extension for LOw-energy Sensing) a low-cost mobile phone extension that works virtually with all the mobile phones, including low-cost phones since it interfaces with the phone over standard audio port and Bluetooth.The proposed platform augments mobile phones with additional sensing capabilities with minimal overhead in terms of energy consumption. MELOS provides capability to switch on-board modules off as per application requirements while keeping low power interface (audio) "always-on" (to keep the connection) thus resulting in significantly small active mode power consumption. Local storage capability on board ensures that the data is transferred over high bandwidth, high-power consuming Bluetooth interface in burst mode resulting in low energy consumption per byte of data transfer. Interface with a mobile phone ensures that the capabilities of the MELOS platform can be exploited remotely using the cellular connectivity. Using MELOS, we prototype a sample application to monitor energy consumption of several electrical appliances and also demonstrate appliance control using a relay based circuit.</p>
